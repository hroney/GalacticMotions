> This project is based on the paper arXiv:1211.4045. The main idea is to visualize the dynamical behavior of astrophysical objects 
(e.g. galaxies) taking into account both the gravitational attraction between them and the cosmological expansion of the Universe

## Theory

We consider astrophysical objects deep inside the cell of uniformity (i.e. $R<150$Mpc). The comoving distances in the cell of uniformity are much less than 1: li â‰ª 1 -> we can use the Cartesian coordinates. Thus, we can write
